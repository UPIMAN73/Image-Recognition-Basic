Convolutional Neural Networks:

Base train images:
Find one image to train the computer
    Setup Image and turn into an array
    Analyze the array and convert the RGB values into percentage values (Blackscale or white scale or gray scale)
    Setup a unit matrix that will analyze the picture and break apart matrix as values for another matrix
    Other matrix analyzes last layer as a way to represent and define the object in computer format
