Convolutional Neural Networks:

Base train images:
Find one image to train the computer
    Setup Image and turn into an array
    Analyze the array and convert the RGB values into percentage values (Blackscale or white scale or gray scale)
    Setup a unit matrix that will analyze the picture and break apart matrix as values for another matrix
    Other matrix analyzes last layer as a way to represent and define the object in computer format


Convolution Layer:
    This layer is important because it is the foundation of a CNN
    It requires a filter layer or a subsection layer that is the same size as the matrix you are using to analyze the image.
    Filter layers are feature based sections of an image that help identify what the image is.
    Filter layers dictate the arithmetic needed for the CNN to be computed


Pooling Layer:
    This layer is also important because it is the layer that essentially encodes the CL (Convoluted Layer)
    It helps direct the machine in a way that is simply indentifies features within the image
    Used for the Final Layer
    Uses comparison thresholds to decide whether or not the feature is present.


Final Layer:
    This layer uses a pool matrix to compare all of the other pools to the pool that you just wanted to classify
    You essentially use some basic arithmetic to calculate the response of the image that is a close match to the image that you want to classify
    From this approach, you can easily classify images.
    However, that does not mean it is the most accurate way to classify them.


Output Layer:
    All of the information will be saved to a text file showing the results of the simulation and the calculations process
    All of the correctly called characters are recorded along with the filters
